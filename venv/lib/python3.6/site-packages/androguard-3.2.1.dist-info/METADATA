Androguard is a tool and python library to interact with Android Files.

Usually they come in the form of Android Packages (APK) or Dalvik Executeable (DEX) files.
Androguard has tools to read Android's binary format for XML files (AXML) and is also suited with a decompiler for DEX.

Androguard might not only be used as a tool for reverse engineering single applications, but features a lot of functions
for automated analysis. It provides a pure python framework to build your own analysis tools.
